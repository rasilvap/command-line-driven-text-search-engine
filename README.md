# command-line-driven-text-search-engine

The exercise is to write a command line driven text search engine in the language you feel most
comfortable with.
Examples of the usage would be:
python simple_search.py ​<pathToDirectoryContainingTextFiles>
or
java​ -jar ​<jarName>​ ​<mainClassFile>​ ​<pathToDirectoryContainingTextFiles>
This should read all the text files in the given directory, building an ​in-memory​ representation of the files
and their contents, and then give a command prompt at which interactive searches can be performed.
An example session might look like:
$ java -jar SimpleSearch.jar Searcher /foo/bar
14 files read in directory /foo/bar
search> to be or not to be
file1.txt:100%
file2.txt:90%
search>
search> cats
no matches found
search> :quit
$
The search should take the words given on the prompt and return a list of the top 10 (maximum)
matching filenames in rank order, giving the rank score against each match.
Note:​ ​ ​We would like to see a working console application, please focus your attention on the search
algorithm and the basic console functionality (you can assume that the input strings are sane).
  
## Rank
  
  The rank score must be 100% if a file contains all the words
  
● It must be 0% if it contains none of the words

● It should be between 0 and 100 if it contains only some of the words, but the exact ranking

formula is up to you to choose and implement
